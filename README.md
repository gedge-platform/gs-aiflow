GS-aiflow is the workflow management Framework for machine learning operations - pipelines, training and inferences.
When workflows are defined, they become more maintainable, versionable, testable, and collaborative.
With GS-aiflow you can use workflows as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) of tasks. The GS-aiflow scheduler executes your tasks on an array of workers while following the specified dependencies. 

Aiflow offers a set of lightweight environments that can be used with any existing machine learning application or library (TensorFlow, PyTorch, Keras, ONNX etc), wherever you currently run ML/DL code (e.g. in notebooks, standalone applications).
